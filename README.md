The Pepper Production Management System was developed as part of our academic studies to assist pepper farmers in managing their operations more effectively. The system addresses challenges such as manual record-keeping, inefficient resource management, and limited market access, aiming to streamline operations, improve decision-making, and enhance the profitability and sustainability of pepper farming.
