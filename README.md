Working : 
- The Pepper Production Management System provides a robust platform for managing various aspects of pepper farming. Upon logging in, admins gain access to a comprehensive dashboard where they can manage pepper details, including adding new pepper varieties with specific IDs, names, and prices. The system allows for efficient management of producer information, enabling admins to input and update producer details such as name, ID, address, and contact information. Consumers can be added to the system, with connections made to specific producers and pepper varieties. The order management functionality tracks each order with unique order numbers, linking them to consumer IDs, pepper IDs, and order dates. Additionally, the system includes a labor management page to record and track labor contributions in the farming process. Billing and invoicing are streamlined through an automated system that generates bills based on Bill IDs, Consumer IDs, and Order IDs. This integrated approach ensures that all aspects of pepper production and sales are well-coordinated and efficiently managed.
